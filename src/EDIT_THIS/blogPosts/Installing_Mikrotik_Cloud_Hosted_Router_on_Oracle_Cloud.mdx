Setting up a **MikroTik Cloud Hosted Router (CHR)** on Oracle Cloud is not a plug-and-play process since the CHR image isn't available in Oracle's marketplace (as of time of writing). But donâ€™t worryâ€”Iâ€™ll guide you through every step of the setup, ensuring your router is secure, functional, and accessible.

#### what you need to achieve this:

- A device (mobile phone or pc)
- An internet connection
- A debit card (make sure you use one there is no cash in it)

## **Step 1: Download the MikroTik CHR Image**

1.  <ExternalLink href="https://mikrotik.com/download">
      **Visit the MikroTik official image download website**.
    </ExternalLink>

2.  Download the latest **CHR image in VMDK format**â€”this format is crucial for Oracle Cloud deployment.

<Hr />

## **Step 2: Set Up Your Oracle Cloud Environment**

To host the MikroTik CHR, you need an <ExternalLink href='https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html'>**Oracle Cloud account**</ExternalLink> with a properly configured network and storage.

**Note**: this is where you will use the empty debit card to setup an account.

### **Networking Setup: Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)**

When you finish creating an account and finally log into your account;

1. **Go to Oracle Cloud Console** â†’ **Networking** â†’ **Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)** â†’ **Security Lists** .
   - This is where all your ingress and egress rules are managed.
2. For security reasons, in **ingress** disable SSH access at this stage to prevent unauthorized access to your created instance.
   - This ensures the instance isn't exposed before itâ€™s fully set up.

## **Step 3: Upload the MikroTik CHR Image to Cloud**

Since MikroTik CHR isn't available on Oracle's marketplace, you need to **upload the image manually**:

1. **Create a Storage Bucket** in Oracle Cloud.
2. **Upload the CHR VMDK image** to this bucket.
   - Later, when setting up the instance, we will reference this bucket to install the router.

<Hr />

## **Step 4: Create and Deploy the CHR Instance**

1. Navigate to **Compute** â†’ **Instances**.
2. **Create a new instance**.

   - Make sure to keep everything at _Always Free-Eligible_
   - Change the Image to the CHR you uploaded to the bucket.

   - Under the Add SSH keys, click no ssh keys
   - Under Boot Volumes, uncheck any options there.

3. Once the instance is up, **log into the router** via the Oracle Cloud Console terminal.
   - The console will automatically log you into MikroTik CHR for the first time.

## **Step 5: Secure the Router & Enable Remote Access**

1. **Change the default password** to secure the router.
   - When logged in in the oracle shell, mikrotik will require you to change password before proceeding.
2. Return to **Networking > Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) > Security Lists > Ingress** and **re-enable the SSH rule** for remote management.

<Hr />

## **Step 6: Connect to MikroTik CHR via Terminal or WinBox**

With an internet connection, you can now:

- Log into the CHR via SSH using a terminal.

  <pre className="w-[300px] sm:w-full p-5 overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre bg-gray-300 dark:bg-gray-900">
    <Code
      language={"js"}
    >{`ssh admin@Your_Public_IP //change Your_Public_IP to your instance IP `}</Code>
  </pre>
</div>

- Use **WinBox**, MikroTikâ€™s graphical management tool, for an easier setup experience.

<Hr />

## **Step 7: Enabling Web Access to MikroTik CHR**

If you need to access the **MikroTik WebFig (GUI)**:

1. Go to **Oracle Cloud Console** â†’ **Networking** â†’ **Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)**.
2. Under **Security Lists**, go to **Ingress Rules** and allow:

   - **Port 80 (HTTP)** for basic access.
   - **Port 443 (HTTPS)** for secure access.

     <img src="/blogImages/oracle3.PNG" className="shadow-2xl "></img>

### **Setting Up HTTPS (Port 443) for Secure Web Access**

- To avoid exposing data over HTTP, you can enable HTTPS using an SSL certificate.
- You have two options for SSL certificates:
  1. **Self-Signed Certificate** (Recommended for personal use).
  2. **Certificate Authority (Let's Encrypt or other CA)** (Requires a domain name).
     - If you donâ€™t want to buy a domain, you can use **free DDNS services**.
     - However, since this guide is for **a completely free setup**, a self-signed certificate is the best choice.

<Hr />

## **Step 8: Accessing MikroTik WebFig**

- Open any **web browser** and enter the **public IP address** of your instance.
- If using HTTPS, your browser will likely display a **security warning** (since it's a self-signed certificate).
  - Simply click **"Advanced"** and proceed. There's **no risk**, as it's your own CHR instance.
- **HTTP access won't show any errors**, but keep in mind that **your ISP or any middleman could intercept your traffic**.

<Hr />

## **Step 9: Full Remote Access to MikroTik CHR**

Once set up, you can access the router using:

âœ… **Terminal (SSH or Telnet)** - use your mobile device (termux) or PC (terminal)

âœ… **Web Browser (WebFig - HTTP/HTTPS)**

âœ… **WinBox (MikroTikâ€™s GUI tool)**

<Hr />

### **Final Thoughts**

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™ve successfully deployed a **MikroTik CHR on Oracle Cloud**â€”completely for free! Now, you have a powerful cloud router at your disposal for remote networking, firewall management, VPN configurations, and more.
