summary: In the process of troubleshooting our borehole submersible pump, to know if its gone bad, I learnt how underground water is stored. Holy Moly!!

# It took two days for the aquifer underneath us to recharge.

At night, at around 7, I turned on the pumping machine to bring up water from our borehole.
The pump did its job, but halfway, it stopped bringing up water.
I already know how long it takes to fill the water tank, which is roughly 45 minutes.
I noticed the pumping machine wasn’t bringing up water when I went to check after 30 minutes of turning on the pump.
I went to check if someone else had turned off the pump, but it was still at on.
My next thought was that our borehole pump has gone bad.
Then I noticed something, I could hear the pumping machine spin but no water.
I realized air was coming out from the pipe, so I guess this was why I could hear the machine spin.
I checked a blog and the blog was like you can get water up if you get rid of the air first;
applying this principle to using a straw to sip from a coke bottle…you need to get rid of the air first
in the straw by sucking, so the fluid can go up.
Anyway I noticed the pumping machine spun either anti-clockwise or clockwise –
I couldn’t tell…but I notice like every 30secs, it spun in a way that pushed air out of the pipe,
and after that there was like a suction force for another 30secs that got air into the pipe…
SO I got rid of the air using my palm,
blocking the pipe during the suction force period to prevent air from going into the pipe,
then during the period the pump seemed it was expelling air, I removed my palm,
allowing the air inside the pipe out of the pipe. After like 5-10 cycles of that activity,
I noticed a force of water come out, but it was whitish brown as hell, like It was muddy,
and the rate of outflow reduced after a while; I needed to repeat the same activity in order
to create pressure to help increase the flow rate <span className="text-blue-700 dark:text-green-400 font-bold">This helped me know the pumping machine wasn’t bad.</span>

Now, Underground water level getting low; Damn, never knew that could happen. I
knew wells get low or dry out. I guess I didn't know how wells even worked. Anyway, I didn't know what was actually happening
underground, because like most other persons, I thought underground water was
like a water bank, for example lake, river or cave water but UNDERGROUND. _NAH_ ; check the
videos below to understand how water is stored underground:

Yeah, so anyway, I didn’t want the pumping machine to get all muddy and overall
get overheated due to pressure I was putting it on. **So all I had to do was
wait till the acquifer we were on got recharged.**
